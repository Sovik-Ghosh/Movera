# MOVERA

The new era enhances the visual experience with creative arts and computer-generated imagery. Therefore, to showcase visually stimulated movies, ’Movera’, a chatbot has been developed to take movie requests as user input and then process the best movie recommendation.

## TECHNOLOGY

The chatbot uses an extensive range of frameworks:-
- Python-3.9: The primary programming language used for external API calls, custom action builds, and variable logic.
- RASA: The core of the chatbot is built using the Rasa framework, including Rasa NLU for Natural language Understanding and Rasa Core for story management.
- TMDB API: The bot leveraged The Movie Database API to fetch information about movies including title, genre, vote average, director’s name, actor’s name, etc.
